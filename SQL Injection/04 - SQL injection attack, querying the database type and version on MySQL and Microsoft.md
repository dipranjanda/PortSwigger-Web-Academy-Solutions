# ðŸ§ª Lab 4: Finding Database Type and Version (MySQL / Microsoft SQL)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This lab helps us practice **SQL Injection using UNION SELECT** to retrieve the **database version and type**, whether it's **MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server**.

---

## ðŸ§  What Is the Goal?

We want to display the **version string** of the database by using SQLi and identifying:
- How many columns the query returns
- Which column is printed on the page
- The correct syntax for that DBMS (MySQL or MSSQL)

---

## ðŸ§ª Step-by-Step Solution

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Intercept with Burp Suite

1. Open the lab
2. Use **Burp Suite** and intercept a request (e.g., a product filter or search)
3. Send the request to **Repeater**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Find Column Count with `ORDER BY`

Inject payloads like:

' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER BY 2--
' ORDER BY 3--


Stop when you see an error.  
âœ… The last successful number means that many columns exist.

ðŸ“Œ In this lab: We found **2 columns**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Use UNION SELECT to Retrieve Version

Use the database version function in a UNION SELECT payload:

- âœ… For MySQL:
```sql
' UNION SELECT @@version, NULL--
```

âœ… For Microsoft SQL Server:
`' UNION SELECT @@version, NULL--`
ðŸ’¡ The second value (`NULL`) is used to match the second column to avoid errors.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Encode Payload if Needed
In Burp Suite, if youâ€™re editing the URL or parameters, you may need to:

URL encode characters like ', space, --

Example encoded:

`%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20@@version%2C%20NULL--`
Use Burpâ€™s right-click â†’ Encode â†’ URL

## ðŸ§  Final Working Payload
`' UNION SELECT @@version, NULL--`

This will return the version string (e.g., MySQL 5.x or Microsoft SQL Server 2019), and the lab will mark as solved.

## âœ… Lab Solved!
Once you see the database version printed on the page, the lab will be successfully completed.

## ðŸ’¬ Tips for Beginners

| Concept        | Meaning                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `@@version`    | Built-in variable that shows the DB version |
| `UNION SELECT` | Combines query results                      |
| `NULL`         | Placeholder to match unused columns         |
| `ORDER BY n--` | Helps find how many columns are returned    |
