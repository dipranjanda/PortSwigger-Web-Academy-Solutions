# 🔐 Lab 2: SQL Injection Vulnerability Allowing Login Bypass

## 🎯 Objective

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the **login function**.  
We need to exploit this vulnerability and **log in as the `administrator` user without knowing the password**.



## 🧠 What's Happening in the Backend?

In most login forms, the backend checks your credentials using a SQL query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND password = 'pass123';
```
If the condition is true, login is successful.

If not, it returns an error or shows "Invalid credentials.

## 🚪 The Problem
We don’t know the administrator’s password.
But we can trick the SQL query into thinking the password check is true by injecting a SQL condition that always passes.

## 💣 Injection Strategy
We'll use the common SQL Injection payload:
`administrator' OR 1=1--`

This payload will:

Close the original string with `'`

Inject `OR 1=1` to make the condition always true

Use `--` to comment out the rest of the query.

## 🧪 Final SQL Query Looks Like:
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' OR 1=1--' AND password = '';`

The database now checks:

ㅤㅤ`username = 'administrator' OR 1=1` → ✅ Always true

The rest (`AND password = ''`) is ignored by `--`


## 🧪 Step-by-Step Solution
1. Go to the login form in the lab

2. In the Username field, enter:
   `administrator' OR 1=1--`
3. Leave the Password field blank (or enter anything)
4. Click Log in
✅ You should now be logged in as `administrator`.

## ✅ Lab Solved!
We successfully bypassed the login system using SQL injection, even without knowing the real password.


## 🧠 Why It Works
| Part     | Meaning                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `'`      | Ends the original string                       |
| `OR 1=1` | Always evaluates to TRUE                       |
| `--`     | Comments out the remaining SQL after injection |
